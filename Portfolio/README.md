* The site is complete, and includes the following three required pages:
	* A styled landing page.
	* An about page that helps describe your journey to become a junior developer.
	* A projects page which uses the GitHub API to display your three most-starred repositories
* The GitHub API is correctly implemented.
* The top three most-starred repositories are displayed on the projects page.
* The required functionality must be present by the end of class Friday 03/03/17
* The project should be in a polished, portfolio-quality state
* The project demonstrate understanding of this week's concepts; If prompted, be ready to discuss our code with an instructor using the correct terminology.

This project was developed during a "Code Review" session at Epicodus, which is a solo project designed to test our knowledge of the materials learned over the previous week's study. It's an honor to be part of a coding community where people are genuinely interested in what they're doing.
